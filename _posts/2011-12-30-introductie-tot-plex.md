Plex (also known as "Plexapp" or "Plex Media Center") is a partially open-source freeware media player for Intel-based Apple Macintosh computers and PC computers running Microsoft Windows OS. It has a 10-foot user interface design for the living-room TV. Its source code was initially forked from XBMC Media Center on May 21, 2008 which Plex today uses as an application framework platform for its GUI (Graphical User Interface) and media player part of their software.Similar to XBMC and Boxee, it is an alternative to Apple's Front Row for Mac, with skinnable and user-configurable interface.

Plex integrates content from iTunes and iPhoto (from the iLife software suite) as well as allowing the user to manage all video, photos, music, and podcasts from a computer, optical disk, local network, and the Internet using an Apple or Harmony remote control. In 2009 the developers added their own "app store" digital distribution platform called "Plex Online" with a growing list of community driven plugins for online content like Hulu, Netflix, and CNN video that are being distributed via "Plex Media Server" application which runs as a stand-alone software and media management interface.
Plex began as a freeware hobby project but since 2010 has evolved into a commercial software business that is owned and developed by a single for-profit startup company, (Plex, Inc.). It is a high tech company based in the United States that is responsible for the development of the Plex front-end and back-ends, its client.server model, and all accompanying software under the "Plex" trademark, as well as the exclusive copyright of the closed source software/code parts, both when distributed on its own or when it comes as third-party software component in products by other manufacturers via a strategic partnership.
